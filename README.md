# encryption

This is a relatively simple algorithm used to encrypt a series of 12 words with a string key. The same algorithm can also decrypt the resulting string only if the given key is correct. 

I created this as a fun way to store seed words from crypto wallets (unsure how safe this is, so don't recommed using with your actual seed phrase).

Enjoy!
